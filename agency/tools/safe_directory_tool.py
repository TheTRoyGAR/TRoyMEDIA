"""A directory-listing tool that won't blow the context budget.

crewai_tools' DirectoryReadTool does a raw, unfiltered os.walk() over
whatever directory it's pointed at — no exclusion list, no size cap. Pointed
at a real project root that includes node_modules/.next/.git, a single call
can return millions of tokens in one shot (this happened for real on
2026-08-31: TRoyGO's CTO audit tried to send a 2.9M-token prompt against a
200K-token API limit and crashed outright). Task-prompt instructions like
"don't read node_modules" don't help — the tool call itself already returns
the full listing before the agent gets a chance to follow that instruction.

This tool walks the tree itself, prunes known junk directories before
descending into them (so they're never even stat'd, let alone listed), and
hard-caps the number of paths returned so a real answer always comes back
instead of a hard API failure.
