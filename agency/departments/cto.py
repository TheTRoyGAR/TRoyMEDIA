    """CTO Department — 5 agents running all technology for TRoyMEDIA.

    Real audit capability (added 2026-09-27): before this, none of these
    agents had any tool at all — no way to read the real codebase, so any
    "audit" or "fix" they produced was invented from training memory, not
    grounded in TRoyMEDIA's actual code (the same gap already found and
    fixed for the Script Development Specialist's access to the real
    Oblomov novel text — see agency/departments/production.py). Modeled on
    TRoyGO's CTO department (TRoyLAB-Repo/agency/departments/cto.py), which
    already had this fixed: read-only-first (code_reviewer/security_auditor
    can only read, never write), audit_codebase() is the real entry point
    for "find real bugs," and run_task/security_audit/deploy are kept as-is
    for the existing server.py routes.
